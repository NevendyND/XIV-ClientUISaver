# XIV-ClientUISaver
A Batch Program to In/Export your UI in Final Fantasy XIV

Hey guys, I play FF14 on 3 PCs so it's a bit "difficult" to play with a lot of different UI layouts. 

And because I'm lazy
I made a little Batch-Programm.

You can use this Batch to Import, Export, Clean your UI Settings Folder.
The only thing you need is a USB-Stick where you can save your UI-Settings etc. 
The Batch copied the whole Files inside the "FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn"-Folder, also Screenshots, downloads etc.

In advance, I am sorry for my poor English 
Hope the Batch helps you :)


I want to Improve the Batch from time to time.
Better Text's etc
